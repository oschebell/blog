Well this is it. My first ever blog post about my first steps into the great unknown that is the web. I've decided out of pure curiosity to explore the (seemingly endless) world that is web development and design. Though it goes a whole lot deeper and wider than those categories but you get the point. That, and also the fact the I doubt anyone is actually reading this. But that's cool. I'll write it for me all the same :)

So anyway, as it is at this point in time, I'm actively following workshop videos with Team Treehouse and so far have ventured into the realms of HTML and CSS. I also started out with JavaScript but sheesh, that's something future Owen can deal with if he wants but for now I'll focus on the more front-end-designy stuff. You can keep your functions for now JS.

This blog itself is a static Jekyll site rather than a wordpress or tumblr etc. Why? Well mostly because it kinda felt badass to 'blog like a hacker' and I figured it will be good practice for me to work more and more with text editors (Atom 1.0 at this stage) and terminal commands than another WYSIWYG editor. But mostly I just think its badass.

Ok so from here out, I'll just be posting up any progress/lessons/failings/creations I make for the hope that it might work as a diary to show my progression from knowing literally nothing about web design, development and coding to wherever it ends up taking me.

I'm going in...Wish me luck!
