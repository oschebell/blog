Well I finally did it! Built my first basic blog using Jekyll and I am hosting it for free on Github Pages. Very cool.

It was all pretty straight forward following along to the "Build a blog with Jekyll" workshop at Team Treehouse though it uses Yamyl Front Matter and the Liquid templating langauge along with the use of Terminal commands and some ruby commands. Most of it is well beyond my level of knowledge so it was pretty challenging but glad its worked!

At this point the blog is pretty much using a slightly modified version of the Jekyll starter theme so I'll be sure to continue to play with the CSS until I get it to a point I'm happy with but to be honest, the basic template is actually quite nice.

Cheers.
